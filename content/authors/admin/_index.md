I am an associate research scientist in <a href="https://www.tamuct.edu/coba/cis.html" target="_blank">the Department of Computer Information Systems</a>,  <a href="https://www.tamuct.edu/index.html" target="_blank">Texas A&M University Central Texas, United States</a>. My research interests are focused on computer science, and more specifically on software engineering, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence, model-based development, and empirical software engineering. I am involved in a main project with U.S. agencies. I conduct applied research in the fields of cybersecurity and artifical intelligence.
Prior to coming to the United States, I was a research associate at <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu" target="_blank"> the University of Luxembourg</a> from December 2018 to April 2021. I received my B.Sc. from the <a href="https://www.uniba.it" target="_blank">University of Bari</a> (Italy), M.Sc. from the <a href="https://www.uclm.es" target="_blank">University of Castilla-La Mancha</a> (Spain) and <a href="https://curve.carleton.ca/c01f6172-67fe-476b-90fc-b40ccc78b7ad" target="_blank">Ph.D.</a> from <a href="https://www.carleton.ca" target="_blank">Carleton University</a> (Canada) in 2009, 2011 and 2018, respectively.
